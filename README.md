## Description

Final project for UTD SYSM 6302 / MECH 6317 S23. Analysis of DART bus network.

- [ ] Cocitation
- [ ] Components
- [ ] Communities

- [ ] SIR/Cascade
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Visualization <--
- [ ] Others

## Todo

- [ ] Add edges to nodes based on real world distance to reflect walking
  traversability. Only add edges based on a threshold to not destroy our
  computers with math.
    - Period of waiting between bus stops
- [ ] Analyze travel time variance over times of the course of a day
- [ ] Investigate Google API (optional)
